#Welcome to Tech Books!

This repo was created to help people discover which technical books they should be reading, those they might want to avoid and everything in between.

What will you read next?

##The Goal

You are encouraged to submit your own reading lists, along with a short comment on what you thought of the book (bit longer than a tweet, bit shorter than a few paragraphs).  Hopefully, in time, we'll build up comprehensive lists of the leading technical books in a range of programming languages or tools. 

##Structure

I've created a few files for different programming languages to kick things off - feel free to add more.  

At the top of the page, under the 'Contributors' heading, add your details in this format:

    [github-username](https://github.com/<github-username>)

Please add your books to the list in alphabetical order (make sure it isn't already listed) then, underneath, add your name and what you thought of it, like this:

    Tocacar: Great read, well written and packed full of good quality advice.  Would suit a intermediate-level developer. A must read.

When adding new books, please add them in alphabetical order by book title, so people can easily find items on the list.  Include a link too, if you can.  Please don't add the book a second time if it's already listed, take a moment to check and see if it's already there.

##Future

If this idea takes off and people actually add books to the list, I will look at ways to make it more user friendly before things get out of hand.  If you have any ideas or suggestions, please open an issue and share them.

##Sponsorship

If you think this is a great idea and want to provide free hosting for a proper website, please let me know!  We have [PHPDeveloper](http://www.phpdeveloper.org/) for blog posts, and [ProTalk](http://protalk.me) for videos, it would be GREAT to have community driven list of Tech Books too.
