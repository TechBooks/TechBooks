##Books

### [Build Mobile](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Build-Mobile-Websites-Smart-Devices/dp/0987090844)

Tocacar: An ok book. I can't bring myself to rave about it but have no complaints either.

### [Filemaker Web Publishing, a complete guide to using the API for PHP](http://www.amazon.com/FileMaker-Web-Publishing-Complete-Guide/dp/1598220411)

Tocacar: This book covers everything you need to know to get the most out of Filemaker's API for PHP.  Even a rank beginner can follow it.

### [Mastering Object Oriented PHP](http://www.masteringobjectorientedphp.com/)

Tocacar: Read my review [here](http://phpwomen.org/blog/2013/03/28/book-review-mastering-object-oriented-php/)

### [php|architect's Zend PHP 5 Certification Guide](http://www.amazon.com/architects-Zend-Certification-Study-Guide/dp/0973862149)

Tocacar: A brisk trot through the areas covered by the exam. Not suitable as a single resource for preparation, but to be fair it is just a guide.

### [PHP Master: Write Cutting Edge Code](http://www.amazon.com/PHP-Master-Write-Cutting-Edge/dp/0987090879)

Tocacar: Read my review [here](http://phpwomen.org/blog/2012/01/10/book-review-php-master/)

### [PHP Objects, Patterns and Practice](http://www.apress.com/9781430229254)

Tocacar: Not suitable for a total beginner, I'd say,  but ok for a promising novice ready for the next level.  Not a particularly exciting read, but has good content nevertheless. Worth persevering with.

### [PHP Web Services](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920028291.do)

Tocacar: Short and concise, good coverage of the topic and well written. If you're on the fence, I say buy it.  My review should appear on the linked page soon.

### [Pro PHP Security](http://www.amazon.com/Pro-PHP-Security-Application-Implementation/dp/1430233184/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1377197302&sr=1-1&keywords=pro+php+security)

Tocacar: I read this book too early, it was one of my first (a few years ago now).  I don't recall anything specific but definitely plan to read it again.
